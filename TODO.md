# To Do List

- Add computation of commonly used criterions (e.g. SURE, GCV).
- Move Lkl and InverseProblem structure in criterion file.
- Add keywords of the different optimization method directly in the structures
  Solver, instead of a different list of keywords for each solve function.
- Generalize precision matrix to support structures like ASAP.
